Before publish, make sure name same with repo in aws. For example
"name": "@dm/bigfish"

Check path of index.js in either src/ main
"main": "src/index.js",
"module": "src/index.esm.js",
"types": "src/index.d.ts",

Every time we make changes in directory either installing new package or adding new component we need to increment the version, for example
"version": "0.0.3" to "0.0.4"

Then, publish
npm publish


To use package,
we need to install or add the package, for example
npm install @dm/bigfish
yarn add @dm/bigfish

import the component using
import Component from "@dm/bigfish"
